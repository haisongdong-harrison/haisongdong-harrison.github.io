user_description: >
  I was born and raised in Xi'an where I gained initial experience in programming in elementary school and junior high scholl. I then
  obtained my B.Eng. degree in Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, majored in Energy and Power Engineering. Despite
  studying very different disciplines, I have devoted most of my spare time in several robot- or automation-themed nationwide competitions,
  from which I learned the basics of robot and software development.
  <br/><br/>
  Afterwards, a new chapter of my life has started in Japan. Under the supervision of Prof. Hiroshi Ishiguro, I received my M.Eng. degree
  from Osaka University. I continued my research of Biomechanics and Human-Machine Interaction in doctoral program. In the meantime, I
  completed an entrepreneurial and tech-transfer training program and patented a mobile robot platform as the co-inventor.
  <br/><br/>
  With an engineering mindset, I decided to exit the program in the end in order to pivot into a new career in the robot industry.
  I since joined two startup companies as a founding member developing domestic and industrial robot application, respctively. 
  <br/><br/>
  My major responsibility at work is to design and develop robot software, from image processing and motion planning to decision making and
  business logic. But my interdisciplinary background and working in startup companies made me a generalist as well. So I also do 3D modeling,
  simulation and data analysis from time to time. These experiences enables me to take the leading role of a development team in various projects.
