user_description: >
  I was born and raised in Xi'an where I gained my initial experience in programming in elementary school and junior high school. I then
  obtained my B.Eng. degree in Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, majored in Energy and Power Engineering. Despite
  studying very different disciplines, I have devoted most of my spare time in several robot- or automation-themed nationwide competitions,
  from which I learned the basics of robot and software development.
  <br/><br/>
  A new chapter of my life started in Japan after that. Under the supervision of Prof. Hiroshi Ishiguro, I received my M.Eng. degree
  from Osaka University. I continued my research of Biomechanics and Human-Machine Interaction in doctoral program. In the meantime, I
  completed an entrepreneurial and tech-transfer training program and patented a mobile robot platform as the co-inventor.
  <br/><br/>
  With an engineering mindset, I decided to exit the program in the end in order to pivot into a new career in the robot industry.
  I since joined two startup companies as a founding member developing domestic and industrial robot application, respctively. I am now working
  for Ascent Robotics Inc. helping the team building autonomous vehicle technology and AI-enabled pick-and-place solutions.
  <br/><br/>
  My major responsibility at work is to design and develop software for various robotic applications, usually with C++ and Python. But honestly
  I'm passionate about solving software engineering problems in all forms. My interdisciplinary background and experience in startup companies
  also made me a generalist (e.g. 3D modeling, data analysis, etc.). Despite my preference in first-hand software development as an engineer,
  I'm no stranger to management and confident in taking a leadership role for software engineering projects when needed.
