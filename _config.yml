user_description: >
  I was born and raised in Xi'an where I gained initial experience in programming in elementary school and junior high scholl. I then
  obtained my B.Eng. degree in Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan, majored in Energy and Power Engineering. Despite
  studying very different disciplines, I have devoted most of my spare time in several robot- or automation-themed nationwide competitions,
  from which I learned the basics of robot and software development.
  <br/><br/>
  Afterwards, a new chapter of my life has started in Japan. Under the supervision of Prof. Hiroshi Ishiguro, I received my M.Eng. degree
  from Osaka University, researching on the design and evaluation of exoskeleton suit. I continued my research of Human-robot interaction
  in doctoral program on topics such as full-body wearable sensor network and its application in a motor learning assistance coaching system.
  In the meantime, I completed an entrepreneurial and tech-transfer training program and patented a mobile robot platform as the co-inventor.
  <br/><br/>
  With a problem-solving, engineering mindset, I decided to exit the program in the end in order to pivot into a new career in the robot industry.
  I since joined two startup companies as a founding member developing domestic and industrial robot application, respctively.
