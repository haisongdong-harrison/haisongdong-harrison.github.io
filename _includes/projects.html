    <p>Bubble Lab is dedicated to introducing innovative automation technologies to the foodservice industry, which helps to bridge the gap between human and
       machine. Their previous work focused on the design of intelligent devices for cafés and restaurant. This project is a whole new attempt. We took advantage
       of the power of UR3, a collaborative industrial robotic arm, to develop a computer-vision-based robot to interact with customers and provide on-demand
       service. The robot is currently in beta test at Dotcom Space, Beijing. My contribution of the project: </p>

    <p>A two-week experiential training course on commercialization of early-stage technology. Groups are formed by experts with different backgrounds, and a real
       technology under development is assigned to each group for thorough assessment in terms of its feasibility of commercialization. For a technology with
       great potential, participants are required to perform market research, prior art search, etc. and draft business plan to evaluate its profitability. On the
       final pitch day, the groups will present the assessment results to actual venture capitalists and investment could be made to bootstrap promising business.

    <h3> Full-body Sensing Network Based Motor Skill Coaching System </h3>

      <li> <strong>Covered topics: Biomechanics, Movement Analysis, Kinetic Chain, Sensor Fusion, Data Acquisition, Statistical Analysis, Data Visualization, 
        3D Modeling, Golf, Putting Stroke, EEG, ERP</strong> </li>
    </ul>
    <p>This research aims to develop a novel coaching system that can substantially improve motor learning efficiency for certain sports skills. We developed an
       18-channel 6-axis full-body wearable sensor network in order to obtain real-time, precise biomechanical data for high-performance movement analysis. Golf
       putting stroke is selected as our target skill in the experiment. We are then able to compare movement patterns of professional athletes and amateur players
       and derive necessary on-line feedback signals to help the amateur players' movement converge to the professionals'. In the end, we also attempted to develop
       a self-evaluation sub-system using event-related potential (ERP) so we know if the user reacted to our feedback timely or not.</p>

    <h3> Timing Issue in Power-assisted System </h3>

        Data Visualization 3D Modeling, EMG</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is a continuation of the previous work on the exoskeleton. We investigated the commonly neglected timing issue in power-assisted devices and designed
       an EMG based evaluation method to verify our hypothesis. As a result, we achieved above-the-norm performance with well-timed assistance than most of the
       other proportional-EMG-controlled human augmentation devices. A journal paper has been published in <i>SICE Journal of Control, Measurement, and System
       Integration</i> titled <i>On the Well-Timed Assistance in Power-Assisted Sit-to-Stand Movement</i>. </p>

    <ul>
      <li> <strong>Covered topics: Mechanical Design, Exoskeleton, Pneumatic Actuation, Biomechanics, Legged Locomotion</strong> </li>
    </ul>
    <p>We designed a lower-body exoskeleton for power assistance in daily activities. Our prototype has been through several iterations. The initial concept was to
       incorporate energy recycling mechanism so the suit could be quasi-passive and energy efficient. We then adopted the tensegrity structure in Architecture in 
       order to reduce the overall size. The final exoskeleton is more similar to traditional designs, which employed one air cylinder each leg as the main actuators.
       Encoders are also mounted on hip, knee and ankle joints for gait detection and movement analysis.

    <p>The Freescale Cup is similar to the Renesas competition below but has more restrictions on the car itself. To improve the algorithm-heavy system's performance,
       for the first time we tried to use a real-time kernel(µC/OS-II) on the Freescale HCS12 and won a district 3rd prize in the end.

    <p>A smart line-tracking car built on top of the Renesas H8/3048F-ONE microcontroller. The goal is to race on an unknown track at maximum speed with only eight
       IR sensors in front. We customized the car using high-performance coreless DC motors and encoder and achieved ultra low failure rate at 3.2m/s. I worked as
       the algorithm architect with my team and won the 1st prize winner.
