    <h3> Interactive Robot Arm </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> <strong>Covered topics:</strong> Hierarchical State Machine, Motion Planning, Visual Servoing, Collision Avoidance, Singularity Avoidance, 
        Inverse Kinematics with Jacobian, Face Detection, Person Tracking, Hand Tracking, Pose Estimation</li>
    </ul>
    <p> Bubble Lab is dedicated to making technology an essential part of people's daily life. Their previous work focused on the design of intelligent devices
      and automation in the food service industry. This project is a whole new attempt. We took advantage of the power of UR3, a collaborative industrial robotic
      arm, to develop a computer-vision-based robot to interact with customers and provide on-demand service. The robot is currently in beta test at Dotcom Space,
      Beijing. My contribution of the project: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Designed the software architecture and hardware solution.</li>
        <li>Focused on visual servoing, motion planning and controller
            implementation with singularity avoidance added.</li>
        <li>3D image processing and computer vision algorithm integration (i.e.
            face detection/person tracking/pose estimation) with Intel RealSense
            camera.</li>
        <li>Also responsible for business logic and GUI development.</li>
        <li>In charge of project management and communication with Bubble Lab
            (China) team.</li>

    <h3> PLEN Cube </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> <strong>Covered topics:</strong> Behavior Tree, Face Tracking, Panorama Stitching, Beat Tracking, Voice Recognition, Video/Audio Streaming, 
        Motion Control, Wireless Communication, TDD, Software Deployment</li>

    <p>PLEN Cube is a portable personal assistant robot that fits in the palm of user's hand. It is the first product of PLENGoer Robotics (current PLEN Robotics)
      that I developed as a founding member of the company. My major accomplishments include: 
      <ol>
        <li>Recruited and trained interns, conducted negotiation with third-party solution provider and
            provided technical evaluation in place of a resigned CTO.</li>
        <li>Designed the software architecture based on behavior tree.</li>
        <li>Implemented most major functionalities of the robot, including: 
            video/audio streaming, beat tracking for dancing with music, face
            tracking, voice control, gesture control, low level hardware/software
            interface and wireless communication.</li>
        <li>Deployed application on multiple machines using Ansible.</li>
      </ol>

    <ul>
      <li> <strong>Covered topics: Tech Transfer, Commercialization, Entrepreneurship, Case Study, Elavator Pitch, Market Research, Business Plan,
        Technology Assessment, Venture Assessment
      </strong> </li>
    </ul>
    <p>A two-week experiential training course on commercialization of early stage technology. Groups are formed by experts with different backgrounds, and a real
      technology under development is assigned to each group for thorough assessment in terms of its feasibility of commercialization. For technology with
      great potential, participants are required to perform market research, prior art search, etc. and draft business plan to evaluate its profitability. On the
      final pitch day, the groups will present the assessment results to actual venture capitalists and investment could be made to bootstrap promising business.
